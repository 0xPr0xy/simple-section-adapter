Notice
---------
**Simple Section Adapter** is now part of an even more awesome [Adapter Kit] project!

About
-----

This is the **SIMPLEST** [Section Adapter][google-search] available for Android's [ListView][list-view-link]. It works with list adapters that you already have. No project specific dependencies. Just include the [latest jar][jar-download] or the [sources][sources-download-link] to your Android project.

Pros
----

  - The simplest implementation yet, you can create a sectioned ListView with just *6 lines* of code.
  - Zero project specific dependencies.

Compatibility
-------------

  - Android 1.6 and up

Usage
-----
```java
// 1. Create a Sectionizer    
class BookSectionizer implements Sectionizer<Book> {

    @Override
    public String getSectionTitleForItem(Book book) {
        return book.getGenre();
    }

    @Override
    public void smoothScrollToPosition(int position) {

        //implement this if you want to use the Sidebar with section letters (Optional)
        listView.smoothScrollToPosition(position);
    }
}

// 2a. Wrap your existing adapter with the SimpleSectionAdapter
SimpleSectionAdapter<Book> sectionAdapter = new SimpleSectionAdapter<Book>(context, 
        yourBookAdapter, R.layout.section_header, R.id.title, null,
        new BookSectionizer());

// 2b. (Optional) If you want to use the Sidebar with section letters
SimpleSectionAdapter<Book> sectionAdapter = new SimpleSectionAdapter<Book>(context, 
        yourBookAdapter, R.layout.section_header, R.id.title, alphabetLinearLayout,
        new BookSectionizer());
    
// 3. Set the SimpleSectionAdapter to your ListView
listView.setAdapter(sectionAdapter);
```

Also you can check a [complete example][simple-example-link] for a quick start. The [sources][sources-download-link] have a few more examples as well.

**NOTE: The data source (Cursor, ArrayList or Array) provided to your Adapter should be sorted in a logical way you want them to be sectioned. For instance, if you want to section your books by genres, they have to be sorted by genres before you wrap it within the [SimpleSectionAdapter][simple-section-adapter].**

OnItemClickListener
-------------------
While using an [OnItemClickListener][item-click-listener] instead of using the list item's position directly, use it as shown below.

```java
@Override
public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parentView, View view, int position, long id) {
    // 1. You could do this
    City city = (City) sectionAdapter.getItem(position);
        
    // 2. Or you could do this :)
    int index = sectionAdapter.getIndexForPosition(position);
    City sameCity = cities.get(index);

    // More codeâ€¦
}
```
